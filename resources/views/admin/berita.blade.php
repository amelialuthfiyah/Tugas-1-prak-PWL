                                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Are Zayn Malik and Selena Gomez meant to be? The pair have been sparking dating rumors after reportedly being spotted out and about together, but it seems like Zayn may have been harboring a secret crush on Selena for far longer.

                                                    As first noted by Popsugar, an old tweet from Zayn was recently dug up by fans given the buzzy dating speculation around him and Selena. Let's travel way, way back to November 2010, when "Like a G6" by Dev and "What's My Name?" by Rihanna were at the top of the charts, Selena was performing with her band The Scene, and Zayn and the rest of the One Direction crew were fresh off The X-Factor, unaware of the total pandemonium that awaited them. 
                                                    
                                                    On November 19, Zayn tweeted Selena with a flirty "hey" Fans have since revisited the tweet and are flooding the replies with funny comments like, "Never give up on your crushes guys." Period!</p>

                                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Of course, neither Zayn nor Selena Gomez has said anything to confirm or deny their alleged romantic relationship, and everything surrounding them thus far is just speculation — but if the two are dating, it certainly seems like things were written in the stars... or the tweets, anyway. Siri, play "Kiss You" by One Direction please!
                                                        Are Selena Gomez and Zayn Malik Dating? It's unclear what's really going on between Selena and Zayn since neither of them have spoken out about the rumored romance. However, they both follow each other on Instagram.
                                                        Selena had dinner with Zayn's personal assistant, Taryn Zimmerman, on March 21, as the pair were photographed leaving Nobu restaurant in New York City. It came two days before the “Wolves” singer and the former One Direction member were allegedly spotted kissing.
